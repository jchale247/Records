# Record Music
### Project by Joseph Hale
## What is it?
Record Music is a simple web app that allows the user to add music albums to their collection to keep track of the albums they own. 

The application searches the Spotify API based on an entered search field. The user can then choose to add any of the displayed albums that are returned. 

If an album is added, a custom Java Spring Boot backedn api is called to store the album information in a MongoDB database.
