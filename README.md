# Records
### Project by Joseph Hale
## What is it?
Records is a music tracking paltform for keeping a record of what albumns an individual owns and of what media type the albumn is (Vinyl, CD, Cassette, or digital) 

This system was created as a means for me to check if an album is part of my collection with a quick glance while out at a record shop or second hand store to make sure I dont double buy an album.

The system uses spotify's API to allow for quick selections of albumns.
As well as a system for custom album input
